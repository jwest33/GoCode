I want to build a Task Management REST API in Go. I have a detailed specification in this file. Please read initial-spec.md and create a plan for implementing this project.

================================================================================
Okay, let's see what the user needs. They're working on a Go REST API for task management using SQLite, following a detailed spec.

First, I need to check the current status of their project. The last update shows that the directory structure has been created successfully, and they've initialized the Go module. The error message indicates that `go mod tidy` was needed after initializing the module, but it wasn't run yet.

The next step in their todo list is to initialize the Go module with `go mod init`. They tried running it, and the output shows that the module was created with the path `github.com/yourusername/task-api-tutorial`, which is placeholder text. This means the module name might not be correct for their actual repo, but since it's a tutorial, maybe that's okay. However, they should ideally use an actual module path or leave it as is if this is a local project.

The stderr message also suggests running `go mod tidy` to add module requirements and sums. So after initialization, they need to tidy up dependencies. But since they're just starting, there are no dependencies yet, so `go mod tidy` will just clean things up.

But wait, looking at their todo list: Step 2 was to initialize the Go module, which seems like it's done now. The next step should be step 3: Implement db.go for SQLite connection and pool.

Wait, let me check their todo list again. The updated todo list says:

1. [✓] Create directories for cmd/api, internal/database, internal/handlers, internal/models, tests
2. [ ] Initialize Go module with `go mod init`

They might have run `go mod init` successfully, but the error message mentions `go mod tidy` is needed. However, since the user hasn't explicitly mentioned an issue with dependencies yet, maybe the main thing is to proceed with implementing db.go.

So the next action should be to create the db.go file in internal/database/db.go. This file should handle database connection setup, including SQLite connection using sql.Open, setting up connection pooling, and initializing the schema via migrations.

But wait, before that, they need to make sure the go.mod file is set up correctly. The stderr output shows it's created as github.com/yourusername/task-api-tutorial. If the user intended to use a real module path, they should change it, but since this is a tutorial, maybe it's acceptable as-is.

Now, since step 2 (Initialize Go module) is pending completion, the correct next step would be to run `go mod tidy` or check if the module was initialized properly. However, the user might have already run `go mod init`, and the error message is just informational.

Given the todo list, after initializing the module, the next step is to implement db.go. So I should probably create the db.go file with the necessary code for SQLite setup.

But first, let me make sure there are no missing dependencies. For SQLite, the usual driver is `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3`. So the user will need to add that to their go.mod file. But since they haven't added dependencies yet, they should first import that package.

Wait, the error message from the stderr says "go: creating new go.mod", so the module was created, but no dependencies are specified yet. To use sqlite3, they'll need to run `go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` before proceeding.

Hmm, so maybe the next thing is to add the sqlite3 dependency. But according to the todo list, step 2 was initializing the module, which has been done. Step 3 is implementing db.go, but db.go will require the sqlite3 driver.

So perhaps the correct order is:

1. Initialize module (done)
2. Add sqlite3 dependency via `go get`
3. Then implement db.go

But in the todo list, step 3 is Implement db.go. Maybe they can do it after adding dependencies.

But looking at the user's context, the assistant just created main.go and directories. The next logical step is to set up the database connection.

So, let's proceed to create db.go with the necessary code for SQLite setup, including importing the sqlite3 driver.

Wait, but the sqlite3 driver needs to be imported. So first, we need to import it, but since the module hasn't had dependencies added yet, we should first run `go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` to fetch the package.

Alternatively, when creating db.go, if the import isn't there, the build will fail. So maybe the assistant should first add the dependency.

Given that, the best next action would be:

- Use bash command to run `go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3`
- Then create db.go with the correct imports and connection logic.

But according to the todo list, step 2 is Initialize Go module, which they've done, and step 3 is Implement db.go. So perhaps the assistant should now proceed to create db.go, assuming the dependency will be added later or during the build.

Wait, no—actually, without the sqlite3 driver, db.go can't compile. So the assistant should first add the dependency before writing db.go.

So steps to take:

1. Run `go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` to add SQLite driver.
2. Then write db.go in internal/database/db.go.

But let's check the current directory structure. The user has directories created: cmd/api/, internal/database/, etc.

So the plan is:

- Add sqlite3 dependency
- Create db.go file

Since the user hasn't run `go get` yet, this should be done now.

The assistant should execute a bash command to install the sqlite3 driver.

Then, after that, create db.go with content for database connection and initialization.

So the next steps are:

1. Run `go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3`
2. Write db.go file in internal/database/db.go with SQLite setup code.

Let me draft the db.go content.

db.go should:
- Import sql and sqlite3 drivers
- Define NewDB function that opens SQLite connection
- Handle connection pooling (SQLite uses pooling via db.SetMaxOpenConns)
- Initialize schema via migrations

But migrations will be handled in migrations.go, which is step 4 in todo.

For db.go, focus on connection setup.

Example code for db.go:

package database

import (
	"database/sql"
	"fmt"

	_ "github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3"
)

var DB *sql.DB

func InitDB() error {
	var err error
	DB, err = sql.Open("sqlite3", "./tasks.db")
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to open database: %w", err)
	}

	// Set connection pool parameters
	DB.SetMaxOpenConns(10)
	DB.SetMaxIdleConns(5)
	DB.SetConnMaxLifetime(10 * time.Minute)

	// Check connection
	if err := DB.Ping(); err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to ping database: %w", err)
	}

	return nil
}

// Then in main.go, call InitDB()

But since the user's todo list has step 2 as initializing module (done), step 3 is db.go implementation, so we need to do that.

So first, run `go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3`, then create db.go.

Wait, but the assistant can't run bash commands directly—they have to use the bash tool function.

So, the assistant should:
1. Call bash with command to install sqlite3 driver.
2. Then write db.go file.

Let me check if there are any other dependencies needed. For validation and HTTP handling, maybe standard libraries suffice.

Alright, proceed step by step.
